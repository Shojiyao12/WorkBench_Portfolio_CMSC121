## Quickstart Guide
1. Copy all the contents from this repository.
2. Copy all files and directories to the htdocs directory inside xampp (for example: C:\xampp\htdocs\CMSC121), where "CMSC121" will contain all of the files.
3. If the webpage for CMSC121-L5-Yao_SJ doesn't work yet, import the databases [imdb_small.sql] in phpmyadmin or directly embed it into your MySQL database through the command prompt (refer to this link on how - https://www.warp.dev/terminus/mysql-import-sql-file). 
4. Open your XAMPP Panel and make sure to start your APACHE and MySQL 'Modules' under 'Actions' (refer to this link, if you do not have XAMPP, yet - https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
5. Open any browser, enter localhost, and browse the file location on the search bar. (i.e. localhost/CMSC121)
